h1. strip_podcast

h3. Description

A small utility to strip the ID3 tags used by iTunes to identify a file
as a podcast track.  I use this utility to strip off these flags so that
podcasts may be treated as normal songs in iTunes.

h3. Installation

This software requires taglib.  I recommend installing taglib through
Darwin Ports (http://darwinports.com) via the command 
@sudo port install taglib@.

Once installed, modify the @TAGLIB_PATH@ in the Makefile to point to
the location where taglib is installed (for Darwin Ports, the default
value should be acceptable).

Then simply run @make@ to build the software.  You'll get a single
executable file named strip_podcast.

h3. Usage

Just run @strip_podcast <filename>@ to remove any of the ID3 tags on
the file.  The file is modified in place and may then be imported into
iTunes as a standard track.
